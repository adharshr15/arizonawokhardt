        "text": "hi baby im on ft with you rn and youre sleeping. i love watching u sleep (not in a weird way) youre so cute it makes me so happy. i started working on the arizonawokhardt website today, i think itll turn out really cool. i have a little less than 3 months to finish it so i think i can get it done. i want it to be like a digital scrapbook of our relationship that we can update as time goes by. theres a blog section where u can write me notes and i can write u notes like on co star. a music section where you can post songs that remind u of me and vice versa. a gallery with pictures of us that we love. an outfits page where we can look back at what we were wearing on certain memorable days. a scrapbook page with random items and artifacts of meaning to only us. you can listen to all of the mixes we ve made for each other on the site and it also says exactly how long we ve been together. if everything goes to plan, you should be reading this on our 1 year anniversary. if youre reading this before or after, i either spoiled it to early or it took me longer than i thought it would...anyways youre still sleeping like an angel i think im going to go join you. i hope i make it into your dreams, you always make your way into mine.  i love you baby!! - H",
