        "text": "hi baby im on ft with you rn and youre sleeping. i love watching u sleep (not in a weird way) youre so cute it makes me so happy. i started working on the arizonawokhardt website today, i think itll turn out really cool. i have a little less than 3 months to finish it so i think i can get it done. i want it to be like a digital scrapbook of our relationship that we can update as time goes by. theres a blog section where u can write me notes and i can write u notes like on co star. a music section where you can post songs that remind u of me and vice versa. a gallery with pictures of us that we love. an outfits page where we can look back at what we were wearing on certain memorable days. you can listen to all of the mixes we ve made for each other on the site and it also says exactly how long we ve been together. if everything goes to plan, you should already know all of this by know, i want to give this to you for our 1 year anniversary. if youre reading this and have no idea what im talking about though, thats really embarrassing for me...anyways youre still sleeping like an angel i think im going to go join you. i hope i make it into your dreams, you always make your way into mine.  i love you baby!! - H",
